# Calculate-Compound-Interest
Compound interest is calculated using the following formula:  P (1 + R/n) (nt) - P
Here P is principal amount.
R is the annual interest rate.
t is the time the money is invested or borrowed for.
n is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t, for example if interest is compounded monthly and t is in years then the value of n would be 12. If interest is compounded quarterly and t is in years then the value of n would be 4.
